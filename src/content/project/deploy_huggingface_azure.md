Today, we are going to deploy a HuggingFace model inside the Azure cloud infrastructure using the Azure Machine Learning cloud service. 

To start doing that, we need to first install some packages dependences from [here](). Please execute the following command with your virtual environment activated.

```sh
wget 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!
